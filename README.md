# exchangeApp
In this project, I made an exchange rate app by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are USD, EUR, and GBP rates for Turkish Lira. Also, there is gold. When I get these rates used an API. In addition, there is a conversion part on the website. You can exchange currencies in that place.
